a.Applications of computer vision
b.Convolutional neural network
1. Why traditionally humans are better at image recognition than computers?
computer cannot recognize changes in how images appear
small changes affect computer prediciton
CNN can be used to combat this
ANN works well for small images
large numbers becomes quite cumbersome eg. 1920*1080*3=6mill in first layer
seconds layer say 4mill hence 24mil weights
2. Disadvantages of using traditional artificial neural network (ANN) for image classification.
3. How human brain recognizes images?
4. How computers can use filters for feature detection
5. What is convolution operation and how it works
6. Importance of ReLU activation in CNN
7. Importance of pooling operation in CNN
8. How to handle rotation and scale in CNN

Convolution padding and stride
. Padding allows corner pixels in image to participate well in feature detection.
 Stride is by how much amount you are moving a filter window during convolution operation.
