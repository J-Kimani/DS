    "# 1. Problem Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The film industry is a high-stakes domain where billions are invested annually in movie production, distribution, and marketing. However, predicting a movie's box office revenue before its release remains a challenging task due to the influence of various complex and interrelated factors such as genre, cast, production budget, and release timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to develop and compare multiple machine learning regression models to accurately predict the box office revenue of a movie using metadata available prior to its release. This includes analyzing the contribution of different features (e.g., budget, cast, genre) and ensuring the model is interpretable and temporally robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "By solving this problem, the project aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders such as producers, investors, and marketers, enabling them to:\n",
    "- Make informed decisions about production and marketing strategies.\n",
    "- Assess the financial viability of upcoming film projects.\n",
    "- Allocate resources more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is focused on:\n",
    "- Using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset sourced from Kaggle.\n",
    "- Treating the task as a regression problem.\n",
    "- Implementing robust preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.\n",
    "- Applying and comparing models like Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.\n",
    "- Ensuring interpretability through SHAP values.\n",
    "- Avoiding data leakage and considering real-world deployment using a Streamlit app.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which metadata features contribute most significantly to movie revenue?\n",
    "- Which regression model offers the best predictive performance?\n",
    "- How can interpretability and model robustness be incorporated into the solution?\n",
    "- Can the model be reliably used in a production environment for real-time revenue prediction?\n",
