    "# Image Classification with Deep Learning  \n",
    "## A Practical Introduction Using the Fashion-MNIST Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Image classification is a core problem in computer vision and a foundational application of deep learning. The task involves assigning a predefined label to an image based on its visual content. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches that rely on handcrafted features, deep learning models particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) automatically learn hierarchical representations directly from raw image data. This ability makes CNNs especially effective for visual recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fashion-MNIST dataset is used as the experimental benchmark. Fashion-MNIST consists of grayscale images of clothing items and serves as a more realistic alternative to the classic handwritten digit MNIST dataset. While the images are relatively small (28×28 pixels), the dataset captures real-world challenges such as inter-class similarity and ambiguous visual patterns, making it well-suited for learning and evaluating convolutional neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Project Objectives\n",
