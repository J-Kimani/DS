    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:**  \n",
    "Analyze participant data from the Everything Data mentorship cohort to understand demographics, motivations, skill levels, and factors influencing graduation. Use data-driven insights to recommend improvements for future cohorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scope:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data cleaning and preprocessing\n",
    "- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Predictive modeling for graduation status\n",
    "- Evaluation of models and actionable recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cleaned dataset\n",
    "- EDA visualizations and summary statistics\n",
    "- Classification models predicting graduation status\n",
    "- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)\n",
    "- Recommendations for program improvement\n",

    "## 2. Project Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Data Acquisition & Inspection\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load dataset using Python (`pandas`).\n",
    "- Inspect data types, missing values, and general structure.\n",
    "- Identify categorical vs. numerical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle missing values (imputation or removal).\n",
    "- Standardize categorical entries (e.g., gender, country).\n",
    "- Encode categorical variables (One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding).\n",
    "- Convert timestamps into usable features if necessary (e.g., month/year of registration).\n",
    "- Check for duplicates and inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demographics Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Age range distribution\n",
    "- Gender and country breakdown\n",
    "- Track-wise participant distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Experience & Motivation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Years of learning experience vs. graduation rate\n",
    "- Hours per week availability vs. performance\n",
    "- Motivation for joining analysis (word cloud or category frequency)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Metrics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distribution of aptitude test completion and total scores\n",
    "- Correlation matrix between numerical features and graduation status\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visualizations:**  \n",
    "Histograms, bar charts, boxplots, heatmaps (Matplotlib/Seaborn).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Predictive Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Predict graduation status.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Selection:** Experience, hours/week, total score, self-assessed skill level, motivation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Models to Compare:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Random Forest Classifier (or Gradient Boosting)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Split data into train/test (e.g., 80/20)\n",
    "- Train models and tune hyperparameters (if necessary)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics to report:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accuracy\n",
    "- Precision\n",
    "- Recall\n",
    "- F1-score\n",
    "\n",
    "- Confusion matrix visualization\n",
    "- Compare models and choose the best-performing one\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Insights & Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify key factors influencing graduation\n",
    "- Provide actionable recommendations:\n",
    "  - Ideal participant profile\n",
    "  - Suggested weekly learning hours\n",
    "  - Support mechanisms for participants at risk of dropping out\n",
    "- Present findings with clear visuals and narrative\n",

Directly encoding such data (e.g., through one-hot encoding or label encoding) would create a sparse, high-dimensional dataset that is inefficient and may not improve model performance.\n",

This simple numeric representation reduces the complexity of the free-text field while still capturing useful information (e.g., longer responses may indicate stronger or more detailed motivations).\n",

    "- **Efficiency**: Converts unstructured text into a single numeric feature.  \n",
